Pushing jai bindings for onion web server, written on top of libmicrohttpd.

This __should__ technically be more mature and stable than custom libraries made in jai... However... When tested this library performs worse than my own so I'm not sure what to do now... God dammit web server stuff is so dumb and shit.
